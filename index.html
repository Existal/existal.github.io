                <p>Hello! My name is Tyler Mueller, and I have always been fascinated by the fields of computer science
                    and engineering. As a high school student, I have been particularly interested in STEM subjects,
                    with a specific interest in robotics, and plan to pursue a degree in Computer Science in college.
                    Through my experience with programming languages such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading
                    Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript, Python, and C#, I have developed a strong skillset and knowledge
                    that has allowed me to create games and websites. Although, I am confident that programming has the
                    potential to address real-world issues beyond the digital world. I intend to use my skills and
                    knowledge to make a meaningful impact in the world. I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge
                    and I view each day as an opportunity to learn something new. As I continue my journey in the fields
                    of computer science and engineering, I am eager to see where it will take me and how I can make a
                    difference in the world.</p>

                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <p>Since a young age, I have always been fascinated by the science behind computers, particularly the
                    ability to program and bring my ideas to life. I taught myself the basics of programming through
                    online resources during my teenage years and started experimenting with code. In the summer of 2019,
                    I had the opportunity to intern at a local computer repair store where I gained valuable experience
                    in computer engineering. There, I learned about computer components and how they work together to
                    perform tasks, common issues that can arise, and how to troubleshoot and fix them. Additionally,
                    I have been expanding my knowledge and skills in web and game development. I recently attended
                    summer
                    camps at the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology, where I learned about Raspberry Pi and
                    coding with Python in 2021, 3D printing in 2022, and STEM Exploration in 2023. These experiences
                    have allowed me to advance my understanding of computer science & engineering and its applications
                    while giving me opportunities to explore different aspects of technology.</p><br>
                <p>Throughout my life, I have actively pursued a variety of interests, from martial arts to robotics to
                    3D printing. These experiences have allowed me to develop a diverse set of skills and expertise,
                    from physical discipline to technical problem-solving. I am always eager to learn and grow, and I
                    consistently seek out new challenges that push me to become better. This same level of dedication
                    and commitment is reflected in my work, where I approach every task with a willingness to go the
                    extra mile and contribute to the success of my team. Whether I am collaborating with others on a
                    project or working independently, I always strive to deliver high-quality work and make a positive
                    impact. I am constantly pushing myself to explore new areas of interest and strive to make a
                    positive impact in all aspects of my life. </p><br>
                <p>I believe that having a fulfilling career is essential because we spend a significant amount of our
                    lives at work. To me, this means finding enjoyment and meaning in what I do every day. I strive to
                    wake up feeling motivated and happy, ready to tackle the day's challenges and work toward my
                    goals. Consistent effort and dedication are crucial to achieving success, and I am committed to
                    putting in the work to achieve meaningful accomplishments. I believe that a positive attitude and a
                    willingness to learn and grow are essential in any career, and I am always looking for ways to
                    improve and develop my skills.</p>
